  * The OnSave event occurs when: 
  *   - The user clicks the Save icon in the lower right corner of the form, even when there is no changed data to be saved.
  *   - Code executes the formContext.data.entity.save method, even when there is no changed data to be saved.
  *   - The user navigates away from the form and there is unsaved data in the form.
  *   - The auto-save option is enabled, 30 seconds after data has changed and there is unsaved data in the form.
  *   - Code executes the formContext.data.save method and there is unsaved data in the form.
  *   - Code executes the formContext.data.refresh method passing a true value as the first parameter and there is unsaved data in the form.
  * 
  * To determine which button was clicked to perform the save, use the getSaveMode method.
  * 
  * You can cancel the save action by using the preventDefault method within the event arguments object.
  * The preventDefault method which is accessible by using the getEventArgs method that is part of the execution context.
  * 
  * Execution context is automatically passed to the form event handler.
